## Reflection

> What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course
> meet, exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > I expected this System Administration course to provide a solid     |
| > understanding of managing and maintaining networked systems, along  |
| > with hands on experience in handling real world scenarios. I was    |
| > hoping to learn about server management, troubleshooting, security  |
| > practices, and automation techniques.                               |
| >                                                                     |
| > The course has met my expectations by . For example, Managing       |
| > Services in Windows as it gave me a hands-on understanding of how   |
| > to control essential services, troubleshoot issues, and optimize    |
| > performance.                                                        |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
> these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > The course covered several essential topics, including user and     |
| > permission management, network configuration, managing services in  |
| > both Windows and Linux environments, system monitoring, and         |
| > security protocols. Also Allowed me to learn how to start, stop,    |
| > and configure services efficiently, ensuring that critical          |
| > applications run smoothly.                                          |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
> strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
> material?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > Throughout the course, I found that a few strategies were           |
| > particularly effective in helping me grasp and retain the material  |
| > through setting up labs and practicing with real configurations in  |
| > Windows and Linux was invaluable. By actually managing services,    |
| > permissions, and network setups.                                    |
| >                                                                     |
| > Regularly testing myself on the topics, such as command syntax or   |
| > troubleshooting steps, helped reinforce my memory and identify      |
| > areas I needed to review.                                           |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
> significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
> effective?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > Yes, several activities significantly enhanced my learning          |
| > experience.                                                         |
| >                                                                     |
| > Activities like managing print services and creating web servers,   |
| > were particularly effective because they allowed me to apply        |
| > theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, building my          |
| > confidence in managing these and solving problems independently.    |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course?
> How did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from
> them?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > Yes, I faced a few challenges during the course, especially with    |
| > configuring network services like DNS and DHCP was tricky, as even  |
| > a small error could cause connectivity issues. To overcome this, by |
| > carefully following each step and documenting any issues I          |
| > encountered. This practice helped me build patience and a logical   |
| > approach to troubleshooting.                                        |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
> promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
> decision-making?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > By continuously challenging us to address real-world problems       |
| > rather than just following instructions, the course enabled         |
| > critical thinking and analysis. For example, I had to examine the   |
| > issue, analyze the possible causes, and choose the appropriate      |
| > troubleshooting strategy for multiple tasks that required           |
| > diagnosing and fixing system problems without a step by step        |
| > process. My ability to solve problems and make decisions has        |
| > improved as a result of this procedure.                             |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

> Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
> perspectives did you gain from this course?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > I learned the importance of persistence, attention to detail, and   |
| > utilizing available resources. With these obstacles helped me       |
| > develop a more resilient mindset and a structured approach to       |
| > problem-solving, skills I know will be essential in real-world      |
| > system administration.                                              |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


> How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
> future studies, career, or personal life?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > I might aim to pursue roles in system administration or IT support  |
| > where I can directly apply the technical skills I\'ve learned, such |
| > as server management, networking, and scripting. I also plan to     |
| > seek out internships or positions that allow me to gain real-world  |
| > experience and further develop my capabilities. The insights I've   |
| > gained about maintenance and security will guide my approach to     |
| > ensuring system reliability and protecting organizational data.     |
| >                                                                     |
| > I plan to use my skills to manage my own home network more          |
| > effectively. This includes implementing security measures,          |
| > optimizing network performance, and automating tasks using scripts. |
| > This practical application will not only reinforce my learning but  |
| > also enhance my personal technology management.                     |
